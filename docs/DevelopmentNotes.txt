These are notes on things and decisions I've made. Trust these unless you have a really good reason.

DO NOT DO THESE THINGS, THEY HAVE BEEN TRIED AND FAILED...
	
	1. Have all "engine systems" be global. This is terrible and leads to dependencies that are hard to see in constructor and initialization stages.
    2. Get stuck researching too much, just start implementing. Refactoring happens later
    3. The build system is fine, move on and code some shit dude!!
    4. 

Build System Notes:
	Run Setup.bat, then can call build.bat. Only call setup once.
